# library
Library practice project.

A small Library app, created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The project is from The Odin Project curriculum.

What I learned with this project;

- Objects And Object Constructors;
- The Prototype;
- Prototypal Inheritance;
- JS Classes (after reconstructing code in branch);
